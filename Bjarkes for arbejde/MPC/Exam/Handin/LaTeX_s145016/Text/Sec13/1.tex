\subsection{Pairing of Inputs and Outputs}
It is known that $u_1$ affects the water level in tank 1 and 4 (due to the valve), which then influence tank 2. The valve is operated such that 58\% of the water from pump 1 is lead to tank 1, and the remaining 42\% is lead to tank 4 (hence tank 2). Opposite, the second valve is set to lead 68\% of the water from pump 2 into tank 2, and the remaining 32\% is led to tank 3. This correlation will mean that classical controllers (\textit{P}, \textit{PI} and \textit{PID}) will have a limited performance.
