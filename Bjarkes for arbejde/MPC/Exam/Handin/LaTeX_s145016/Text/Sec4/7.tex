\subsection{Linearization Approach}
In order to determine discrete time state space model, it is  required to have a exact continuous model of the system. The model is derived from the law of physics and the precision of this is determined under some assumptions. If one uses to many assumptions, in order to simplify the model, it could happen that the final model is not precise enough. Therefore the modelling of a system is often non-trivial. The advantage of the transfer functions from the step responses, is that they can be determined without any modelling, if the system exist and it is possible to do some experiments. By doing this, all the physical properties is taken into account when determining the model.
