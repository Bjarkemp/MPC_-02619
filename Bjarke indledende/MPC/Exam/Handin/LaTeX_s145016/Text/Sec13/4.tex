\subsection{P, PI and PID Controllers Compared to MPC}
As seen in the previous paragraph the classical controllers are able to track a given reference signal, however there is minor overshoots and settling time is increased (compared to the closed loop with MPC), however this could probably be accounted for by better tuning.\\
In the controller implementation, it is possible to limit the inputs of the system to a certain minimum and maximum value (in this case $u$ range from 0-500). However this only works as a saturation, and is not used as input to find an optimal input signal. It is not possible to set a limit on how fast the inputs changes, which of course in real life implementation can be troublesome.\\
